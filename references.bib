  abstract = {Abstract             The main objective of this paper is to provide a web-based tool for identifying faces in a real-time environment, such as Online Classes. Face recognition in real-time is now a fascinating field with an ever-increasing challenge such as light variations, occlusion, variation in facial expressions, etc. During the current pandemic scenario of COVID-19, the demand for online classrooms has rapidly increased. This has escalated the need for a real-time, economic, simple, and convenient way to track the attendance of the students in a live classroom. This paper addresses the aforementioned issue by proposing a real-time online attendance system. Two alternative face recognition algorithms are perceived in order to develop the tool for realtime face detection and recognition with improved accuracy. The algorithms adopted are Local Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face recognition as well as Haar cascade classifier with boosting for face detection. Experimental results show that CNN with an accuracy of 95\% is better in this context than LBPH that yields an accuracy of 78\%.},

  abstract = {Web browsers have been used widely by users to conduct various online activities, such as information seeking or online shopping. To improve user experience and extend the functionality of browsers, practitioners provide mechanisms to allow users to install third-party-provided plugins (i.e., extensions) on their browsers. However, little is known about the performance implications caused by such extensions. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the impact of extensions on the user-perceived performance (i.e., energy consumption and page load time) of Google Chrome, the most popular browser. We study a total of 72 representative extensions from 11 categories (e.g., Developer Tools and Sports). We observe that browser performance can be negatively impacted by the use of extensions, even when the extensions are used in unintended circumstances (e.g., when logging into an extension is not granted but required, or when an extension is not used for designated websites). We also identify a set of factors that significantly influence the performance impact of extensions, such as code complexity and privacy practices (i.e., collection of user data) adopted by the extensions. Based on our empirical observations, we provide recommendations for developers and users to mitigate the performance impact of browser extensions, such as conducting performance testing and optimization for unintended usage scenarios of extensions, or adhering to proper usage practices of extensions (e.g., logging into an extension when required).},

  abstract = {For the past few years in the face recognition research area are made very progressive improvements. This is because of the high level and versatile technologies in use nowadays, and high level of processors running on our machines and mobile phones. Available technologies provide mechanisms which use face recognition for security identification (user face) and authentication purposes. The aim of this paper is to present and propose client - server model and to compare it with the most recent client - server models for face recognition with a GPG infrastructure which uses security private key (symmetric encryption) with main purpose to securely transmit image (user face) over the network. Moreover in the face recognition algorithm is implemented Principle Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm for face recognition. Proposed system has been tested on the mobile phone with Android OS platform, using previous research experiences where system was initially developed for DROID emulator. The implementation of the PCA is done on the MATLAB side.},
